# IaC with Bicep
## A collection of folders that include Azure resources deployment projects using Bicep ARM Templates. 
This material is the work I produced over time during self development work with Microsoft Learn. Different folders include different projects that use different levels of Bicep to create resources in Azure - from fundamental to advanced bicep ARM template. 

*Note: Content for this reposiroty will grow with time.*

### Projects in this repository include work done to demonstrate ability for the following:

**Deploy child and extension resources with Bicep**

Deploy various Azure resources in Bicep code. Define and use child and extension resources. Work with resources created outside a Bicep template or module.

**Manage changes to Bicep code by using Git**

Track of changes to  Bicep code and view the history of the files changed. Use branches to develop multiple versions of  code at the same time. Publish repository to support collaboration.


**Structure  Bicep code for collaboration**

Build Bicep files that support collaborative development and follow best practices. Plan parameters to make  templates easy to deploy. Use a consistent style, clear structure, and comments to make Bicep code easy to understand, use, and modify.


**Review Azure infrastructure changes by using Bicep and pull requests**

Avoid unintended changes and poorly written Bicep code by using pull requests. Use branching strategies to protect  main branch from accidental changes. Understand what to look for when reviewing Bicep code.

**Preview Azure deployment changes by using what-if**

Preview the effects of deployments. Understand the types of changes detected by the what-if operation. Deploy  templates using incremental and complete mode.


**Migrate Azure resources and JSON ARM templates to use Bicep**

Export and convert Azure resources to Bicep files, and migrate JSON Azure Resource Manager templates (ARM templates) to Bicep. Refactor Bicep files to follow best practices. Test Bicep files and deploy them to production.
